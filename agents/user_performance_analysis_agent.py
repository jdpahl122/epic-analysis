        The following developer has completed tasks in the past 6 months:
        {issues}

        Their **average ticket completion time** is **{avg_completion_time} days**.
        Their **average story points per ticket** is **{avg_story_points}**.
        The ticket types they worked on include: {ticket_types}.

        Analyze their performance and answer:
        1. What is their perceived work difficulty based on ticket descriptions?
        2. Are they resolving issues faster or slower than expected?
        3. Are they working mostly on new features, bugs, or refactoring?
        4. Do they need improvement in any area?
